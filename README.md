### Key Features
* Automatic Dual-Axis Tracking: Constantly adjusts solar panel orientation (azimuth and elevation) for maximum sunlight exposure.
* Smart Microcontroller: Built on the 32-bit RISC-V core  for low power consumption and high computational performance.
* Efficient Servo Motor Control: Utilizes real-time feedback for precise, low-power motor movements.
* Energy Optimization: Increases solar panel efficiency by up to 30%, lowering operational costs in the long term.
# Why This Matters 
#### Scalable and Cost-Effective
###### => "SCALABLE" , Perfect for small to medium-sized solar installations, easily scalable to meet growing energy needs.
#### Low Maintenance
###### => This design "minimizes manual intervention", saving time and labor costs.
